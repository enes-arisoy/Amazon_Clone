#Amazon Clone Project

This project is an Amazon website clone designed using HTML and CSS. The aim is to create a user-friendly interface that replicates the core layout and features of Amazon, including the homepage design, product listings, category sections, and a search bar.

In this project:

- HTML was used to structure the content and layout of the website.
- CSS was employed to style the elements, apply a color palette, set typography, and ensure responsive design.

This project was developed to enhance front-end development skills and understand the fundamental design principles of a real-world website.
